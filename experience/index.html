        <h2>Software Engineering Intern - Parsley360 (Summer 2025)</h2>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Summer 2025</p>
        <p>
          Built a scalable, multimodal data-ingestion pipeline (Python + C++) that
          scrapes, OCRs, and cleans documents, cutting manual preprocessing time by ~90%.
          Designed and implemented a DuckDB/MotherDuck (SQL-based) corpus database with
          URI links to S3 storage and SHA-256 deduplication; delivered clean topics and
          embeddings for the demo's reasoning engine. Integrated Gensim LDA + BERTopic
          to generate document-topic vectors and labels powering RAG retrieval and
          ontology mapping, and wrote a high-performance C++ tokenizer. Contributed to a
          temporary Flutter (Dart) app for demo, navigating a large existing codebase to implement fixes.
