        <p>
          I grew up on computers, built three of my own, and spent a lot of time on
          games as a kid. That curiosity pulled me toward Computer Science. I'm excited by
          software that can impact millions at once, and I love exploring autonomous vehicles,
          agentic AI, and (lately) operating systems.
        </p>

          Outside of class, I'm a guitarist/vocalist and songwriter. I spent two years in a
          Santa Barbara band with 20+ shows, including dates in San Jose and LA (plus a couple
          bands back in high school). I ran sprints in early high school, then fell for beach
          volleyball after graduating; now I play with UCSD's Beach Volleyball club and friends.
          I'm a new but enthusiastic skier. Favorite foods: dim sum (pork &amp; shrimp shumai is the best),
          sushi, Thai, and Mexican.
